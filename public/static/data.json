I was motivated by supply chain issues stemming from 2020, anybody from trucking contractors to normal people could help ease the load and move products, while also making some money. This tool is for those who are looking for drivers to contract, while the mobile app is specifically for drivers. Trip tickets can be created, with an integrated and seamless map provided by the Google, with tickets and requests being easily managed in their respective tables. Account management is also easy to use, and is helpful for viewing the latest events that have occurred in the account.",

There is currently a patent pending for the IP, so the GitHub is private.",

Additionally, inventory tracking is enabled if a user desires to track it digitally, and the dashboard contains visually appealing and easy to understand charts to view data. All restaurant ordering data is freely available to the users. Its their data, so all of it is available.",

Multiply this by each stock you are thinking of buying, and you are in for a lot of time spent just searching. Not to mention convoluted visuals and boatloads of information the average investor simply does not care about. I decided to come up with a solution. A project that offers real-time ticker quotes, easy chart visualizations, a watchlist, a risk-free sandbox to get an accurate picture of what you can assume you will buy in at to determine the price you should sell, and a mock portfolio to track your real positions with ease.",

In addition, users can send feedback to me through the website that delivers via both email and text. Language frequency, commit charts, and commit frequency graphs for each repository and account as a whole enhance a visitors understanding of what type of applications and code thats being written.",
